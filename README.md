# Image Transformer

This is an application made purely out of native HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

- Upload an image
- Choose one of three filters: pixelate, invert, or greyscale
- The application will output a new image with the chosen filter
- Save or print the new image(s)

Added image resizer as a quick fix to prevent pixelation cropping
